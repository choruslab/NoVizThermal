# thermaltrackpad

This repository includes all of the code for my thermaltrackpad prototype we used to explore how non-visual feedback can support users in behaving securely online. If you would like full details about the project, feel free to email: daniela.napoli@carleton.ca

=== We stand on the shoulders of giants! ===

Although much of the code has been customized for our purposes, this prototype is based upon Liz Coelho's arduino project and Reginald Watson's Open Sound Control (OSC) web app example. Links are included below:

=== Future work! ===

Next steps for this project include:
- optimizing the web app
- including new components to the Arduino prototype to help control the thermal stimulation

Come back soon for more!
