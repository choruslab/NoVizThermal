# thermaltrackpad

This repository includes all of the code for my thermaltrackpad prototype I used to explore how non-visual feedback can support users in behaving securely online. If you would like full details about the project, feel free to email me at: daniela.napoli@carleton.ca

=== We stand on the shoulders of giants! ===
This prototype was based upon Liz Coelho's code/schematics and Maker Pro's Open Sound Control (OSC) web application example. Links are included below:
