# thermaltrackpad

This repository includes all of the code for the thermaltrackpad prototype we use to explore how non-visual feedback can support users in behaving securely online. 

=== The Team ===

This prototype started as Daniela Napoli's course project for exploring the role of embodied cognition in usable security. Sebastian Navas refactored and optimized the web app to what you can see today! 

Right now, we're exploring ways to improve thermal feedback and other potential non-visual feedback implementations. If you would like full details about the project, feel free to email: daniela.napoli[@]carleton[dot]ca

=== We stand on the shoulders of giants! ===

This prototype was inspired by Wilson et al.'s exploration of thermal feedback, Liz Coelho's controllable heater project, and Reginald Watson's Open Sound Control (OSC) web app example. Links are included below:
